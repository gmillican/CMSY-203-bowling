git YouTube intro https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE

git commands (must be in local directory where project files are)

git clone - copies project to local from github
git status - shows difference between whats in github and whats local
git add filename (or -A for all) - tells github that there is a new local file to be tracked for the project (doesn't actually put the file in github)
git commit -m "message" filename - puts file info into repository but doesn't copy file to github
git push - sends whatever needs to go from local to github
git pull - copies to local whatever is in github that isn't on local yet
