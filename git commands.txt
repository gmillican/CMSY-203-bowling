git commands (must be in local directory where project files are)

git clone - copies project to local from github
git status - shows difference between whats in github and whats local
git add filename (or -A for all) - tells github that there is a new local file to be tracked for the project (doesn't actually put the file in github)
git commit -m "message" filename - puts file info into repository but doesn't copy file to github
git push - sends whatever needs to go from local to github
git pull - copies to local whatever is in github that isn't on local yet

git branch - shows branches
git branch branchname - creates a copy of master (or parent branch)
git checkout branchname - changes focus to working on branchname copy



common workflow steps:
git checkout master
git pull
git branch to see branches
git branch branchname to create a new branch (creates a full local copy)
git checkout branchname to change to branch you want to work on
edit files
git checkout master to switch to master branch
git pull to get anyone else's changes since last pull
    if changes:
	git checkout branchname to get back to branch working on
	git merge master to merge the other's changes
	if conflicts: look at file and resolve 
git status
git add -A
git commit (Esc :wq to finish comment) (or git commit -m "comment")
git push (may need to add destination branch)
in github gui:
	do a pull request
	review changes
	merge
	delete branch
